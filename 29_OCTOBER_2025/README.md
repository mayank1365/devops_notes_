# DevOps Introduction

## Overview

DevOps is a combination of cultural practices, tools, and processes that improve collaboration between development and operations teams. Its main objective is to deliver software faster, with higher quality and reliability. DevOps emphasizes automation, continuous feedback, shared responsibility, and faster recovery from failures.

## Key Points

- **Continuous Integration**: Developers frequently merge code into a shared repository
- **Continuous Delivery**: Automated pipelines prepare applications for release
- **Continuous Deployment**: Every successful build is deployed automatically
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is defined and managed using code
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Track system health and application performance
- **Automation**: Reduce manual effort and human errors
- **Collaboration Culture**: Development and operations work as one team
- **Fast Feedback**: Issues are detected and resolved earlier
