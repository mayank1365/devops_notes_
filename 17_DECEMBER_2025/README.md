# Introduction to CI/CD

## Overview

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) are practices that automate the software delivery process. CI focuses on automatically testing code changes, while CD automates deployment to production.

## Key Points

- **Continuous Integration**: Automatically build and test code on every commit
- **Continuous Delivery**: Automatically deploy to staging/production
- **Pipeline**: Series of automated steps from code commit to deployment
- **Build Automation**: Compile code and create artifacts automatically
- **Automated Testing**: Run unit, integration, and e2e tests
- **Artifact Management**: Store build outputs in registries
- **Deployment Automation**: Deploy to environments without manual intervention
- **Rollback Capability**: Quickly revert to previous versions if issues arise
