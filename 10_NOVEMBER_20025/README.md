# Introduction to Docker

## Overview

Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications along with their dependencies into containers. Containers ensure consistent behavior across development, testing, and production environments.

## Key Points

- **Containers vs Virtual Machines**: Containers are lightweight and faster
- **Docker Engine**: Core runtime that manages containers
- **Images**: Templates used to create containers
- **Containers**: Running instances of images
- **Docker Hub**: Central registry for images
- **Portability**: Run containers on any Docker enabled system
- **Isolation**: Applications run independently
- **Efficiency**: Better resource utilization
