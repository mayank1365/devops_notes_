# Introduction to DevSecOps and Implementing It

## Overview

DevSecOps integrates security practices into the DevOps pipeline. It shifts security left, making it everyone's responsibility from the start of development rather than an afterthought.

## Key Points

- **Shift Left**: Integrate security early in development lifecycle
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing analyzes source code
- **DAST**: Dynamic Application Security Testing tests running applications
- **SCA**: Software Composition Analysis checks dependencies for vulnerabilities
- **Container Scanning**: Scan Docker images for security issues
- **Secret Management**: Use tools like HashiCorp Vault for secrets
- **Compliance as Code**: Automate compliance checks in pipeline
- **Security Gates**: Block deployments if security thresholds not met
- **Tools**: Snyk, Trivy, SonarQube, OWASP ZAP
