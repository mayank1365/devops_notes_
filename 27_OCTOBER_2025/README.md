# Microservices Introduction

## Overview

Microservices architecture is a software design approach where applications are developed as a collection of small, independent services. Each service represents a specific business function and runs in its own process. These services communicate using lightweight mechanisms such as REST APIs or message queues. Microservices improve scalability, fault tolerance, and deployment speed, making them ideal for cloud native and DevOps environments.

## Key Points

- **Service Independence**: Each microservice is developed, deployed, and scaled independently
- **Loose Coupling**: Services interact through APIs without direct dependency on implementation
- **Technology Diversity**: Each service can use different programming languages, frameworks, and databases
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure of one service does not crash the entire system
- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled based on demand
- **Faster Releases**: Smaller services allow quicker development and deployment
- **Team Ownership**: Teams manage services end to end including development and production
- **Challenges**: Requires strong monitoring, networking, and service discovery
