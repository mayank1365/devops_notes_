# Docker Containers

## Overview

Docker containers are lightweight, isolated runtime environments created from Docker images. They are fast, portable, and ideal for microservices.

## Key Points

- `docker run` - Start a container
- `docker ps` - List containers
- `docker stop` and `docker start` - Manage container state
- `docker rm` - Remove containers
- `docker exec` - Run commands inside containers
- `docker logs` - View container logs
- **Volumes**: Persist data
- **Networking**: Enable container communication
