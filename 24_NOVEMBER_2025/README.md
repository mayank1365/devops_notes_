# Introduction to Orchestration Using Kubernetes

## Overview

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a framework to run distributed systems resiliently.

## Key Points

- **Cluster**: A set of nodes that run containerized applications
- **Nodes**: Worker machines (VMs or physical) that run containers
- **Pods**: Smallest deployable units containing one or more containers
- **Control Plane**: Manages the cluster and makes scheduling decisions
- `kubectl` - Command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes
- **Declarative Configuration**: Define desired state in YAML files
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically restarts failed containers
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple pods
